A Python script that uses the GitHub API to automatically unfollow users who don't follow you back.


## Features

- Fetches your followers and following lists
- Identifies users you follow who don't follow you back
- Option to automatically unfollow or preview before unfollowing
- Rate limit handling
- Progress tracking

## Prerequisites

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-unfollow-nonfollowers.git
cd github-unfollow-nonfollowers
```
2. Install dependencies:
```markdown
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

3  Go to **GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)**.
4.  Click **Generate new token**.
5. Select the required scopes:
   - `read:user`
   - `user:follow`
6. Copy the generated token.

## Configure the Token

You can configure the token in one of the following ways:

### Option 1: Edit `config.py`

```

   Following 200 users
